# Wordpress Theme

~~A wordpress theme I am currently in progress of developing for my personal portfolio website.~~
A finished theme but I decided not to use it for my portfolio, it was a good learning experience but the theme is not nearly as good as a theme can be if I use 
professionally made theme or theme component.
Perhaps when I grow more in the field of PHP and wordpress, I will give this another shot.

Inside my webpage I plan to host a blog version of my github. I've played with github blog repository for long enough so I am now slowly moving towards my own blog platform.

It's a great learning experience and comfort zone expansion.
